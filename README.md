# Patient Registration Website

This is a frontend-only Patient Registration app built using **React** and **Pglite** (a WebAssembly version of SQLite) for client-side data persistence. The app allows users to:

* Register new patients
* Query patient records using raw SQL
* Maintain persistent data across page reloads
* Sync updates across multiple tabs in real-time

---

## Features

* **Pglite for Storage**
  All data is stored directly in the browser using SQLite via Pglite (WebAssembly).
* **BroadcastChannel API**
  Ensures updates made in one tab reflect in all open tabs seamlessly.
* **Live SQL Query Panel**
  Run raw SQL queries on the client-side to explore patient data.

## Implementation Overview

* **Frontend Framework**: React (with Vite)
* **Database**: Pglite for in-browser SQLite-like storage
* **Tab Sync**: `BroadcastChannel` to synchronize data across tabs
* **Persistence**: IndexedDB (via Pglite) keeps data across page reloads

---

## Notes

* Make sure your browser supports **WebAssembly** and the **BroadcastChannel API**.
* All data is stored **locally** in the browser; there's no backend.
